log - tensorboard learn how to use -> ok
grid search -> ok
check relu first or after matmul -> ok
unsupervised loss  -> ok, but have to disable normalize output
mean pooling -> ok, need test
save/load model -> ok
find similarity -> ok
more pooling functions
organsize save objs, checkpoints, etc.
add log-degree of node to feature
mean pooling
early stopping
add plot hist to tensorboard
fix graph bookcrossing ds
fix 2 layer aggree

cross-search method for graphrec -> doing
different similarity methods of item-item calculation

evaluation scores for BX -> done
evaluation scores for ML -> done

todo: doing
ngcann, rmse
embed and edge rating
ml-10m, ml1m
diversified recsys
unsupervised embed then supervised edge


todo: future
regularization
convolve weighted mean with rating
mean normalization
another dataset implicit ratings
validation loss / validation trainign
t-sne plot

problems:
- current sampling strategy has a flaw, first pair may get 1 rating, but next one may get 5 rating
- use one convolution layer for now (2 is too long and loss seem to fail to go lower)
- current negative sampling strategy is random, need improvement
